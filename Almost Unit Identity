//This is a near-identiy function that maps the unit interval into itself. It is the cousin of smoothstep(), in that it maps 0 to 0, 1 to 1, and has a 0 derivative at the origin, just like smoothstep. However, instead of having a 0 derivative at 1, it has a derivative of 1 at that point. It's equivalent to the Almost Identiy above with n=0 and m=1. Since it's a cubic just like smoothstep() it is very fast to evaluate:


float almostUnitIdentity( float x )
{
    return x*x*(2.0-x);
}
