//Exponential Impulse - by IQ

//Impulses are great for triggering behaviours or making envelopes for music or animation. 
//Basically, for anything that grows fast and then decays slowly. 
//The following is an exponential impulse function. 
//Use k to control the stretching of the function. 
//Its maximum, which is 1, happens at exactly x = 1/k.

float expImpulse( float x, float k )
{
    const float h = k*x;
    return h*exp(1.0-h);
}
